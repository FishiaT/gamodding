### Installing mods

### For RML mods

For RML mods, it's important to note that some requires installing as a jarmod, and some requires installing to the `mods` folder. Ensure that jarmod order is correct to prevent any potential issues.

### For total conversion mods

Most total conversion mods can be installed the same way as jarmod; however, some will requires replacing the jar instead of adding to the jar (like AlphaVer.)

BetaCraft Launcher (refer to [Getting started](getting-started.md) for more info) is recommended for these types of mod as it allows for seemless installation.

### For Babric/Cursed Legacy/Legacy Fabric mods

Install them the same way as you did on modern Minecraft: add mods to the `mods` folder and you're all set.

**DO NOT add anything to Minecraft jar as it will cause compatibility issues.**
